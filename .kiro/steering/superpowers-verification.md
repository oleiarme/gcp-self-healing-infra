# Verification Before Completion (from Superpowers)

NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE.

## The Gate Function

BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim

## What Requires Verification

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |

## Red Flags — STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification
- About to commit without verification
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"

Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.
